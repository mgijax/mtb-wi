<h2>MMHCdb Basics</h2>
<h3>What information can I find in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Models_of_Human_Cancer_database"> Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHCdb) Database?</a></h3>
<ol>
    <li>The focus of MMHCdb is on in vivo mouse models, including:
        <ul>
            <li>spontaneous and induced tumors in mice</li>
            <li>genetically engineered mouse models of cancer </li>
            <li>diversity panels (e.g., Diversity Outbred, Collaborative Cross, etc.)</li>
            <li>Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Information about cancer models includes the spectrum of tumor types observed and the frequency of specific tumor types.  We emphasize the effect of genetic background on the cancer characteristics of mouse models. For PDX models, genomics data for engrafted tumors and treatment response data for cohorts of tumor bearing mice are available for most models. 
    </li>
    <li>The data about mouse models of human cancer in MMHCdb are acquired from the following sources: 
        <ul>
            <li>the published scientific literature, and</li>
            <li>the direct submission of model information and pathology images from  cancer researchers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Priority for biocuration activities are determined by the novelty of the mouse model, the quality of the data, and the organ system involved. High priority is given to models associated with the cancers with the highest reported mortality in the United States population.</li>
    <li>MMHCdb reports negative as well as positive data. For example, strains of mice that are reported to have a zero frequency of a particular tumor type are included in the database.</li>
    <li>Except for PDX models, the mouse model information accessible from MMHCdb is <b>NOT</b> limited to the strains distributed by The Jackson Laboratory. 
        However, if a strain listed in MMHCdb is distributed by The Jackson Laboratory, a link to the data sheet in the JAX Mice database is provided. 
        <b>MMHCdb collaborates with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) to develop and maintain PDX Finder, a global catalog of PDX models which can be accessed at <a href="https://www.pdxfinder.org">https://www.pdxfinder.org</a></b></li>

	<a name="pdxsearch"></a><h2>PDX Search Form</h2>
<p>Search for PDX models by primary cancer site, diagnosis, and gene variant.</p>

<strong>Tumor type</strong>

<p>The primary site and diagnosis fields are string searches and are not hierarchical.</p>

<p>So "non-small cell lung cancer" will not return "lung squamous cell carcinoma."</p>

<strong>Gene list</strong>

<p>The gene lists in the drop down menus are not comprehensive.</p>

<p>They are a subset of genes that are of interest in cancer (derived from the CTP panel).</p>

<p>The gene variant field contains any gene for which our assays find variants.</p>

<p>This field only recognizes the official HGNC gene symbol.</p>

<p>Or select a gene to see expression levels for that gene across PDX models.</p>

<p>Or select a gene to see models where that gene is amplified or deleted.</p>

<p>Variant, expression and copy number data may not be available for all models.</p>

<strong>Variant data</strong>

<p>The variant data (point mutations and indels) are analyzed from next-generation sequencing using various capture panels:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Truseq (deprecated) - The Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel covers 48 cancer-related genes. <a href="http://www.illumina.com/products/truseq_amplicon_cancer_panel.html"> Link.</a></li>

		<li>CTP - The JAX Cancer Treatment Profile panel covers 358 cancer-associated genes <a href="https://www.jax.org/clinical-genomics/jax-cancer-treatment-profile"> Link.</a></li>

		<li>Whole Exome (limited number of samples assayed) - Agilent SureSelect human exon capture. </li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis of the sequencing output uses the Xenome tool to remove contaminating mouse sequences before alignment and variant calling.</p>

<p>BWA, GATK, and SnpEff are utilized for alignment (GRCh38 human reference), variant calling and annotation.</p>

<p>The variant results also include clinical annotations using the JAX proprietary clinical knowledge base (CKB).</p>

<p>The high quality variants are further filtered to remove likely false positives,</p>

<p>variants with low and modifier impact based on SnpEff annotations, and putative germline variants.</p>

<p>However, all high quality variants that are listed in the JAX CKB database with associated drug efficacy</p>

<p>or cancer-related evidences are retained regardless of the filters.

<strong>Expression data</strong>

<p>The expression data are analyzed from microarray or RNAseq platforms.</p>

<ul>
		<li><h4>Affymetrix microarray HU133 or HG1.0ST (deprecated)</h4>

<p>The arrays were processed with the AffyPLM R package, using quantile normalization,</p>

<p>no background correction, and fitting to a simple model that treats the log Intensity</p>

<p>as a sum of array effect, probe effect, and residual.</p>

<p>The array effect is the "summarized expression" that is equivalent to the median polished value produced by standard RMA analysis.</p>
</li>

		<li><h4>RNAseq</h4>

<p>RNAseq data is first processed with Xenome to extract human sequences.</p>

<p>The human sequences are aligned to the transcriptome with Bowtie, and then expression levels are estimated by RSEM.</p>

<p>RSEM estimated counts are finally upper quantile normalized.</p>

<p>Fusion gene is analyzed using Xenome to extract human sequences and SOAPfuse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gene expression of the CTP panel genes is displayed as a chart of percentile rank z-score,</p>

<p>which measures each gene's model-specific expression in comparison with that gene in all models assayed by the same platform.</p>

<p>The mean and standard deviation for z-score calculation is obtained based on a fixed set of PDX samples for each platform.</p>

<p>Other forms of expression values (e.g. z-score, normalized expression) and expression of other genes not listed on the MMHCdb site can be made available upon request.</p>

<a name="pdxalternateloci"></a>
<h4>Genes flagged with hatched bars in gene expression chart</h4>

<p>Some genes display a fair amount of heterogeneity in the normal population. This means that some may align poorly to the reference genome. 
The Genome Reference Consortium "provides multiple representations (alternate loci) for regions that are too complex to be represented by a single path." 
We have analyzed the data for several samples using both the primary build only and the primary build with the alternate loci. 
Using the extended reference genome introduces complications in interpreting the gene expression, so we have opted to use only the primary build.</p>

<p>We are flagging the genes where the alternate loci are sufficiently different from primary to caution users that expression of these genes could be artifactually lowered.</p>

<p>For gene fusion, the gene symbols upstream and downstream of the fusion are reported and whether the downstream fusion partner is frame-shift or in-frame-shift. Only those with associated drug efficacy or cancer-related evidences are reported to minimize false-positives. Other detected fusions and additional information (e.g. breakpoint coordinates) can be made available upon request.</p>

<a name="pdxCNV"></a>
<h4>Copy number</h4>

<p>The copy number variation is analyzed from the Affymetrix Human SNP 6.0 array. PennCNV-Affy and ASCAT 2.2 is used to predict allele-specific copy number and ploidy. Gene-level copy number is obtained by intersecting copy number segments with genome coordinates of Ensembl genes. In cases where a segment boundary is contained within a gene's coordinates, the most conservative estimate of copy number is used.</p>


<p>In Gene CNV, the copy number of the CTP panel genes is displayed as a chart of log2(cn raw / sample ploidy). The CNV Plots present the difference from sample ploidy along the chromosomes (orange) and indicate where loss of heterozygosity occurs (blue).</p>


<p>Values for specific genes not listed on the MMHCdb site can be made available upon request.</p>


<a name="pdxTMB"></a>
<h4>Tumor mutation burden (TMB) estimation:</h4>


<p>TMB was calculated using variants that</p>
<ul>
    <li>(i) met all quality criteria (coverage, mapping quality etc.), </li>
    <li>(ii) were not present in an in-house curated blacklist of false positive variants from loci that prone to sequencing and analysis errors and/or 
        are associated with highly polymorphic genes (i.e., MUC4, MUC5B, MUC16, MUC17, and HLA-A </li>
    <li>(iii) are likely somatic mutations, and  </li>
    <li>(iv) have a high or moderate functional impact (i.e., non-synonymous changes, frame-shifts, stop losses/gains, and splice-site acceptor/donor changes).</li>
</ul>


  <p> TMB was estimated by dividing the number of variants that met the criteria list above by the length (in Mb) of The Jackson Laboratory <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4481190">Cancer Treatment Profile (CTP)</a> targeted gene panel.</p>
   

   <p>We defined high TMB as 22 mutations/Mb, which was calculated based on the TMB distribution of all PDX models analyzed as follows: Q3 (third quartile of TMB) + 1.5 x inter-quartile range of TMB.</p>


<a name="pdxMSI"></a>
<h4>Microsatellite Instability (MSI)</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/mtbwi/live/www/html/MSIDocumentation.pdf" target="_blank">MSIsensor2</a> algorithm was used to determine MSI status of JAX samples. The samples with MSI Score (MSI-Percentage > 20%)  are considered at MSI-H. This threshold demonstrates good differentiation between MSI-High (MSI-H) and MSI-Stable (MSI-S) samples during MSIsensor2 algorithm development and our internal benchmarking. </p>


<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<p>Detected fusion genes are annotated with the clinical information from the JAX CKB database (similar to variant annotation described above),
and only those with associated drug efficacy or cancer-related evidences are reported to minimize false-positives.</p>

<p>Other detected fusions and additional information (e.g. breakpoint coordinates) can be made available upon request.</p>

<h4>Copy number</h4>

<p>The copy number variation is analyzed from the Affymetrix Human SNP 6.0 array.</p>

<p>PennCNV-Affy and ASCAT 2.2 is used to predict allele-specific copy number and ploidy.</p>

<p>Gene-level copy number is obtained by intersecting copy number segments with genome coordinates of Ensembl genes.</p>

<p>The copy number of the CTP panel genes is displayed as a chart of log2(cn raw / sample ploidy).</p>

<p>Other forms of copy number values (e.g. gain and loss relative to ploidy, loss of heterozygosity)</p>

<p>and copy number of other genes not listed on the MMHCdb site can be made available upon request.</p>
