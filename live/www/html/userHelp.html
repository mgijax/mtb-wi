<h2>MTB Background</h2>
<h3>What information can I find in the Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) Database?</h3>

<p>The Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) was designed to aid researchers in such areas as choosing experimental models, reviewing patterns of mutations in specific cancers, and identifying genes that are commonly mutated across a spectrum of cancers.</p>

<p>MTB supports the use of the mouse as a model system of hereditary cancer by providing electronic access to:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Descriptions of tumors (data are organized by strain and organ of tumor origin)</li>
	<li>Tumor frequency and latency data</li>
	<li>Information on genetic factors associated with tumors and tumor development</li>
	<li>Tumor pathology reports and images</li>
	<li>References, both published and unpublished</li>
	<li>Links to related online resources, including:</li>
	<li><ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" target="_blank">Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.jax.org/phenome" target="_blank">Mouse Phenome Database (MPD)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/" target="_blank">JAX&reg; Mice</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://mouse.ncifcrf.gov/" target="_blank">NCI Mouse Repository</a></li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4>Important information for users of MTB</h4>
<ol>
	<li><strong>MTB reports negative as well as positive data.</strong> For example, strains of mice that are reported to have a zero frequency of a particular tumor type are included
	in the database.</li>
	<li><strong>Tumor data in MTB are from studies of tumors that arise in mice either spontaneously or after administration of some sort of agent.</strong> MTB does not include data on
	tumors that arise in humans or other species and are subsequently transplanted into mice.</li>
	<li><strong>MTB is NOT current with the published literature.</strong> Populating MTB is a high priority, but the volume of data available for mouse cancer biology is very large and
	it will take some time to enter the data. Descriptions of the data sources and data entry priorities for MTB are described below.</li>
	<li><strong>The mouse strain information in MTB is NOT limited to the strains distributed by the Jackson Laboratory.</strong> However, if a strain in MTB is distributed by The Jackson
	Laboratory, a link to the data sheet in the JAX&reg; Mice database is provided.</li>
	<li><strong>The data in the Mouse Tumor Biology Database come from the following sources:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>the published literature (current and retrospective),</li>
			<li>the submission of tumor pathology slides and/or images from investigators (from published or unpublished data), and</li>
			<li>tumor frequency and pathology data from routine animal health screenings of mouse colonies (often unpublished data).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Priority for entering data in the database is determined by the novelty of the mouse model, the quality of the data, and the organ system involved.</strong> The organ systems of high priority are those with the highest reported mortality rate among the United States population, according to the National Cancer Institute.
	</li>

<h2>How to query the Mouse Tumor Biology Database</h2>

<p>You begin the MTB query process by filling out one or more fields in a search form and clicking on the <strong>"Search"</strong> or <strong>"Go"</strong> buttons (depending on search form you use).</p>

<p>Your query results will be returned as a Search Results page with hyperlinks to additional information. A common query strategy is to start with a very general query, review the results, and then go back to the search form and refine the query so that fewer records are returned.</p>

<p>To clear all fields of a search form, click <strong>"Reset"</strong>. This will reset all fields to their default values on the form.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Getting Started, General Search Tips</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can search the database using the Search Box, the Quick Organ Search, one of the search forms labeled Tumor, Strain, Genetics, Pathology Images, References and Advanced or the Tumor Frequency Grid.</li>
	<li>Searching the database is made simple by using a combination of text string and pick list searches for specific terms.</li>
	<li>The following provides general information for MTB queries. Specific information and examples for individual search forms is given below.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="sort"></a>
<h3>How do the sort options work?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The sort option allows you to change the order in which records appear on your results page. The sort options are specific for each search form.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="number"></a>
<h3>How can I change the number of records returned by a search?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The default number of records returned by a search is 25 for Tumor, Strain, and Genetics searches, and 5 for Pathology Image searches. By changing the <strong>"Max number of
		items returned"</strong> in the search form, you change the number of records shown on the subsequent Search results page. To view <strong>ALL</strong> records matching your search criteria,
	choose the <strong>"No Limit"</strong> option.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="text"></a>
<h3>How do I effectively use text string search boxes?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Text based searching generally searches for both names and synonyms carrying the specified text string.</li>
	<li>Text based searches are <strong>NOT</strong> case sensitive. You can use uppercase, lowercase, or any combination of the two.</li>
	<li>Operators offer the opportunity to narrow or expand a text string search.
		<ul><li>Often the default operator is <strong>"contains"</strong>, meaning that items beginning, equaling and containing your term appear on the results page. This operator can be
			changed to <strong>"begins"</strong> or <strong>"equals"</strong>, where appropriate.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="pick"></a>
<h3>How do I effectively use pick list searching?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pick lists are often used to search fields using controlled vocabularies.</li>
	<li>If a pick list is presented in a box multiple selections can be made by doing the following:</li>
	<li><ul>
		<li>On a Macintosh, hold the command (Apple) key down and click the desired items in the list, or hold the shift key down and click two items to select those and all items in
		between.</li>
		<li>On a PC, hold the control key down and click the desired items in the list, or hold the shift key down and click two items to select those and all items in between.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="path"></a>
<h3>How do I access Pathology images in the database?</h3>
MTB offers many pathology images for viewing. You can view these images by :
<ul>
	<li>conducting a Pathology Images Search and viewing thumbnail images on the Pathology Image Search Results page (clicking on a thumbnail image will display the Pathology Image Detail
	page for that particular image record), or</li>
	<li>clicking on the Pathology Reports/Images link in the Additional Information column on the Tumor Summary Page.</li>
	<li>restricting a Tumor or Advanced search to only those records with associated pathology images</li>
</ul>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<hr>
<a name="searchbox"></a>
<h2>"Search for" Search Box</h2>

<p>The "Search for" Search Box provides a quick keyword search against Tumor, Organ, Strain or Genetics records. For more detailed search strategies, use the Search form specific for the area of interest.</p>

<hr>

<p>To use the "Search for" Search Box chose an item or items from the pick list, type your search terms in the text box, and click on the <strong>"Go"</strong> button.</p>

<ul><li>It is possible to choose multiple options from the pick list, or to search all sections of the database by selecting the option <strong>"All Sections"</strong>.</li>
	<li><ul>
		<li>On a Macintosh, hold the command (Apple) key down and click the desired items in the list, or hold the shift key down and click two items to select those and all items in
		between.</li>
		<li>On a PC, hold the control key down and click the desired items in the list, or hold the shift key down and click two items to select those and all items in between.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Searches will return up to 10 records for each section of the database searched upon. Users may need to scroll down the page to view the results from other sections. At the
	base of each section is a link that will allow you to view <strong>ALL</strong> records found in that section.</li>
	<li>Results within each section will be arranged alphanumerically by a default sort parameter.</li>
	<li>The total number of records matching your search criteria will be indicated in the Search Summary under the titlebar for each subsection.</li>
	<li>Search box results use the same result display format as the related query forms. Information included in these pages is summarized in the table below.</li>

<h1> How to Interpret Search Results in MTB</h1>
<a name="interpreting"></a>
<h2>General Tips on Interpreting Search Results</h2>
<p>The following is a brief introduction to the Search Results pages. More detailed descriptions for each page and how to access them are given below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Data in MTB are presented at increasing levels of granularity on Search Results, Summary, Overview and Detail pages for tumor, strain, genetics, pathology, and reference data.
	The Search Results page provides a general overview of records found by your search, while the other pages provide more in depth information on a record(s).</li>
	<li>Search results are alphanumerically sorted by parameter of choice.</li>
	<li>Each page has a title bar at the top, indicating which level of detail is included on the page. Listed just below this title bar is an indicator of the search parameters, how the records were sorted
		(e.g. organ or tumor name), the display limit of the search, and a text string indicating the number of items displayed vs the number of matching records found by the search. (For
	example, <strong>"25 of 50 matching items displayed"</strong>.)</li>
	<li>The default for number of records returned by a search is generally 25 (5 for pathology images searches). You can expand the number of records to view, by requesting a larger number of records
	in the search form. The option <strong>"No Limit"</strong> enables you to view all records.</li>

<strong>Variant data</strong>

<p>The variant data (point mutations and indels) are analyzed from next-generation sequencing using various capture panels:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Truseq (deprecated) - The Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel covers 48 cancer-related genes. <a href="http://www.illumina.com/products/truseq_amplicon_cancer_panel.html"> Link.</a></li>

		<li>CTP - The JAX Cancer Treatment Profile panel covers 358 cancer-associated genes <a href="https://www.jax.org/clinical-genomics/jax-cancer-treatment-profile"> Link.</a></li>

		<li>Whole Exome (limited number of samples assayed) - Agilent SureSelect human exon capture. </li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis of the sequencing output uses the Xenome tool to remove contaminating mouse sequences before alignment and variant calling.</p>

<p>BWA, GATK, and SnpEff are utilized for alignment (GRCh38 human reference), variant calling and annotation.</p>

<p>The variant results also include clinical annotations using the JAX proprietary clinical knowledge base (CKB).</p>

<p>The high quality variants are further filtered to remove likely false positives,</p>

<p>variants with low and modifier impact based on SnpEff annotations, and putative germline variants.</p>

<p>However, all high quality variants that are listed in the JAX CKB database with associated drug efficacy</p>

<strong>Expression data</strong>

<p>The expression data are analyzed from microarray or RNAseq platforms.</p>

<ul>
		<li><h4>Affymetrix microarray HU133 or HG1.0ST (deprecated)</h4>

<p>The arrays were processed with the AffyPLM R package, using quantile normalization,</p>

<p>no background correction, and fitting to a simple model that treats the log Intensity</p>

<p>as a sum of array effect, probe effect, and residual.</p>

<p>The array effect is the "summarized expression" that is equivalent to the median polished value produced by standard RMA analysis.</p>
</li>

		<li><h4>RNAseq</h4>

<p>RNAseq data is first processed with Xenome to extract human sequences.</p>

<p>The human sequences are aligned to the transcriptome with Bowtie, and then expression levels are estimated by RSEM.</p>

<p>RSEM estimated counts are finally upper quantile normalized.</p>

<p>Fusion gene is analyzed using Xenome to extract human sequences and SOAPfuse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gene expression of the CTP panel genes is displayed as a chart of percentile rank z-score,</p>

<p>which measures each gene's model-specific expression in comparison with that gene in all models assayed by the same platform.</p>

<p>The mean and standard deviation for z-score calculation is obtained based on a fixed set of PDX samples for each platform.</p>

<p>Other forms of expression values (e.g. z-score, normalized expression) and expression of other genes not listed on the MTB site can be made available upon request.</p>

<a name="pdxalternateloci"></a>
<h4>Genes flagged with hatched bars in gene expression chart</h4>

<p>Some genes display a fair amount of heterogeneity in the normal population. This means that some may align poorly to the reference genome. 
The Genome Reference Consortium "provides multiple representations (alternate loci) for regions that are too complex to be represented by a single path." 
We have analyzed the data for several samples using both the primary build only and the primary build with the alternate loci. 
Using the extended reference genome introduces complications in interpreting the gene expression, so we have opted to use only the primary build. 
We are flagging the genes where the alternate loci are sufficiently different from primary to caution users that expression of these genes could be artifactually lowered.</p>

<p>For gene fusion, the gene symbols upstream and downstream of the fusion are reported and whether the downstream fusion partner is frame-shift or in-frame-shift.</p>

<p>Detected fusion genes are annotated with the clinical information from the JAX CKB database (similar to variant annotation described above),
and only those with associated drug efficacy or cancer-related evidences are reported to minimize false-positives.</p>

<p>Other detected fusions and additional information (e.g. breakpoint coordinates) can be made available upon request.</p>

<h4>Copy number</h4>

<p>The copy number variation is analyzed from the Affymetrix Human SNP 6.0 array.</p>

<p>PennCNV-Affy and ASCAT 2.2 is used to predict allele-specific copy number and ploidy.</p>

<p>Gene-level copy number is obtained by intersecting copy number segments with genome coordinates of Ensembl genes.</p>

<p>In cases where a segment boundary is contained within a gene's coordinates, the most conservative estimate of copy number is used.</p>

<p>The copy number of the CTP panel genes is displayed as a chart of log2(cn raw / sample ploidy).</p>

<p>Other forms of copy number values (e.g. gain and loss relative to ploidy, loss of heterozygosity)</p>

<p>and copy number of other genes not listed on the MTB site can be made available upon request.</p>


<a name="pdxTMB"></a><h4>Tumor mutation burden (TMB) estimation:</h4>

<p>TMB was calculated using variants that</p>
<ul>
    <li>(i) met all quality criteria (coverage, mapping quality etc.), </li>
    <li>(ii) were not present in an in-house curated blacklist of false positive variants from loci that prone to sequencing and analysis errors and/or 
        are associated with highly polymorphic genes (i.e., MUC4, MUC5B, MUC16, MUC17, and HLA-A </li>
    <li>(iii) are likely somatic mutations, and  </li>
    <li>(iv) have a high or moderate functional impact (i.e., non-synonymous changes, frame-shifts, stop losses/gains, and splice-site acceptor/donor changes).</li>
</ul>
<p>  TMB was estimated by dividing the number of variants that met the criteria list above by the length (in Mb)</p>
<p>of The Jackson Laboratory <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4481190">Cancer Treatment Profile (CTP)</a> targeted gene panel.</p>
   
<p>   We defined high TMB as 22 mutations/Mb, which was calculated based on the TMB distribution of all PDX models analyzed as follows: Q3 (third quartile of TMB) + 1.5 x inter-quartile range of TMB.</p>
