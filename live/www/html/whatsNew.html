<li>To improve the quality and utility of pathology images available, the Mouse Tumor Database (MTB) announces the incorporation of Zoomify technology (<a href="http://www.zoomify.com/" target="_blank">http://www.zoomify.com/</a>) into the web display of pathology images. Zoomify enables the representation of fast and interactive high-quality images on the web using HTML, JPEGs, and Flash. All of these programs are freely available. With Zoomify, users can change the perspective and magnification of an image dynamically. Users whose systems do not support Flash technology will still see pathology images in a static view. (October 2006)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/mtbwi/dynamicGrid.do" target="_blank">Tumor Frequency Grid</a> has been enhanced and expanded. The strain family and organ entries have been made expandable to show frequency results for sub-strains of a strain family and sub-structures of an organ. Each results cell now has a rollover pop-up window that shows strain of origin, organ of origin, highest reported frequency and number of tumor frequency records. The grid is also now generated dynamically directly from the information in the database rather than being periodically updated. (August 2006)</li>
<li>The Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) announces the release of the Advanced Search Form. This form enables researchers to perform complex queries combining search parameters from multiple basic search forms. (July 2006)</li>
<br>
<li>Version 1.0 of the new Mouse Tumor Biology database is now publicly available. With this release MTB has been ported to Sybase as the database platform. This major infrastructure change provides a scalable foundation for future growth of the database and will enable us to develop new dynamic web-based user interfaces and provide programmatic accessible web services. Also with version 1.0, MTB's query interfaces and the results pages have been completely redesigned to match the look and feel of the other databases available through the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) web site. Look for additional features and new tools to continue to be released in the coming months... (May 2005)</li>
<li>Currently MTB holds >16,000 tumor instances in >3,500 genetically defined mouse strains and >1,300 pathology images. (May 2005)</li>
