            Users can search by organ, tumor classification, mouse strain or expression assay platform to find relevant gene expression data sets. 
            Search results provide links to external gene expression data as well as MTB tumor frequency records and strain details.

    <ul>
        <li>
            You can now search MTB using Human Gene Symbols.  Entering all or part of one or more human gene symbols or Entrez Gene Ids into the new Human Gene Search Form returns orthologous mouse symbols and any genetic data attached to these symbols.  These data include alleles and transgenes in mouse strains and tumor specific mutations associated with these symbols.  Links allow users to view detailed tumor frequency, strain and pathology data.  The search page also includes collections of cancer specific human genes reported by various sources which can be used for orthology searches.

            The Tumor Frequency Grid, MTB's interactive graphic display of tumor frequencies, displays as a matrix the strain in which tumors were assessed and the organ systems in which tumors were observed. Our newest enhancements to the Grid allow the user to customize the Grid contents on both axes. Thus, the user can select specific strains or strain families and specific organs or organ systems to obtain a Grid showing any desired combination of strains/families and organs/systems.

            The National Cancer Institute is spearheading a large initiative to develop a
            Cancer Biomedical Information Grid (caBIG; 
            <a href="http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/">http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/</a>). One of the
            components of caBIG is a database of animal models for cancer research called 
            caMOD (<a href="http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov">http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov</a>). Scientific curators from the MTB project are working with the caMOD team on incorportating official standards for gene and mouse strain nomenclature into the caMOD resource. Some of the data related to mouse models of human cancer data represented in MTB have been downloaded from MTB and incorporated into the caMOD database. Additional data (e.g. pathology diagnoses and images, somatic genetic changes in tumors) remain uniquely available at MTB.

        <li>
            To improve the quality and utility of pathology images available, the Mouse Tumor Database (MTB) announces the incorporation of Zoomify technology (<a target="zmfywin" href="http://www.zoomify.com">http://www.zoomify.com/</a>) into the web display of pathology images.  Zoomify enables the representation of fast and interactive high-quality images on the web using HTML, JPEGs, and Flash.  All of these programs are freely available.  With Zoomify, users can change the perspective and magnification of an image dynamically.  Users whose systems do not support Flash technology will still see pathology images in a static view.  An example of a Zoomified image can be viewed at http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/mtbwi/pathologyImageSearchResults.do?referenceKey=93530&maxItems=No+Limit , <a href="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/mtbwi/pathologyImageSearchResults.do?referenceKey=93530&maxItems=No+Limit">Image ID: 1393</a>.

        <li>
            The Tumor Frequency Grid has been enhanced and expanded.  The strain family and organ entries have been made expandable to show frequency results for sub-strains of a strain family and sub-structures of an organ.  Each results cell now has a rollover pop-up window that shows strain of origin, organ of origin, highest reported frequency and number of tumor frequency records.  The grid is also now generated dynamically directly from the information in the database rather than being periodically updated.

            The Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) announces the release of the <a href="http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/mtbpathwi/">Mouse Pathology Submission Form</a> (http://tumor.informatics.jax.org/mtbpathwi/). This form enables researchers to submit
            pathology data directly to MTB for display on the Web.
            <br><br>
            The Pathology Submission Form allows researchers to:
            <br><br>
            * Create Mouse Records including strain and genetics information.<br>    
            * Generate Tumor Diagnosis's specific for a Mouse Record.<br>
            * Include detailed Pathology and Treatment descriptions in each Diagnosis.<br>
            * Attach Images to a Diagnosis to complement the Pathology descriptions.<br>
            * Have editorial access to any of their Data submitted to MTB.<br>
            <br>

            Version 1.0 of the new Mouse Tumor Biology database is now publicly available. 
            With this release MTB has been ported to Sybase as the database platform. This 
            major infrastructure change provides a scalable foundation for future growth of 
            the database and will enable us to develop new dynamic web-based user interfaces 
            and provide programmatic accessible web services.
            <p>
                Also with version 1.0, MTB's query interfaces and the results pages have been 
                completely redesigned to match the look and feel of the other databases 
                available through the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) web site.  Look for 
                additional features and new tools to continue to be released in the coming
                months...</p>
            <p>
                Currently MTB holds &gt;16,000 tumor instances in &gt;3,500 genetically defined 
                mouse strains and &gt;1,300 pathology images.</p>
