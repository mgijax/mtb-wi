%H - Request protocol 
%l - Remote logical username from identd (always returns '-') 
%m - Request method (GET, POST, etc.)

%S - User session ID 
%t - Date and time, in Common Log Format 
%u - Remote user that was authenticated (if any), else '-'

There is also support to write information from the cookie, incoming header, 
the Session or something else in the ServletRequest. It is modeled after the 
apache syntax: 

%{xxx}i for incoming headers 
%{xxx}c for a specific cookie 
%{xxx}r xxx is an attribute in the ServletRequest 
%{xxx}s xxx is an attribute in the HttpSession 

The shorthand pattern name common (which is also the default) corresponds to:
%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b".
